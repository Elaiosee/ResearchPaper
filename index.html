    <h3>"Tremolos are a piece on the side of the electric guitar that makes sound go up and down. The tremolo was invented by Clayton “Doc” Kaufman in 1935. They were known as "Kaufmans" at that time. Kaufman's design was improved on by Paul Bigspy who designed the Bigspy tremolo which improved it enough to make it popular among guitarists of the time.  Some retro and rockabilly style guitarists still use these tremolos on their guitars though it only works well for bending a note down. not both up and down.Fender was the next to improve on the tremolo with a tremolo made specifically for 1954 Fender Stratocasters. It was much more flexible than the Bigspy pickup,bending notes well up and down rather than just down. Many Stratocasters since the first in 1954 as well as other brands have improved upon the tremolo. Double-locking tremolos were even invented in the late 1970's. The most popular of which is the Floyd Rose. These were most popular in hard-rock songs" class="center"</h2>
