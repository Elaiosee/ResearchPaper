    <h3><a href="https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/19777-a-brief-history-of-tremolo">Tremolos are a piece on the side of the electric guitar that makes sound go up and down. The tremolo was invented by Clayton “Doc” Kaufman in 1935. They were
        known as "Kaufmans" at that time. Kaufman's design was improved on by Paul Bigspy<a href="https://www.fender.com/articles/tech-talk/pitch-control-a-tremolo-primer"> who designed the Bigspy tremolo which improved it enough to make it popular
          among guitarists of the time. Some retro and rockabilly style guitarists still use
          these tremolos on their guitars though it only works well for bending a note down. not both up and down.Fender was the next to improve on the tremolo with a tremolo made specifically for 1954 Fender Stratocasters. It was much more flexible
          than the Bigspy pickup,bending notes well up and down rather than just down. Many Stratocasters since the first in 1954 as well as other brands have improved upon the tremolo. Double-locking tremolos were even invented in the late 1970's.
          The
          most popular of which is the Floyd Rose. These were most popular in hard-rock songs</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://www.proaudioland.com/news/history-of-the-amp/"> Tube amplifiers, also called Valve amplifiers are a type of electronic amplifier that uses vacuum tubes to increase the amplitude or power of a signal.Though many different
        kinds of amplifiers have been created since the invention of a tube amp, the tone of the tube amplifier remains superior. The history of the tube amplifier begins in 1904 when Jean Ambrose Fleming invented the vacuum tube that would later
        be used in tube amplifiers. Until this time, most amplifiers were made using thermionic amps.</a> <a href="https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4437"> In 1906, another inventor, Lee De Forest invented the first electronic amplifying device which he
        called the Audion,which included the vacuum tubes Fleming had invented two years before.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_amplifier"> Yet another advancement was made in 1927 by Harold Stephen Black. Negative Feedback which
        allows amplifiers to trade gain for reduced distortion levels which led to the development of the Williamson Amplifier in 1947. The Williamson Amplifier which was very successful at the time of invention.</a> </h3>

        sound waves to electrical energy. Microphone's history began in 1665 when Robert Hooke made an acoustic cup and string style phone which is considered to be the first sound transferring device. However, it wasn't until the 1800's that the
        term "microphone" began being used. In 1876,</a> <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-microphones-1992144"> Emile Beliner invented what some believe to be the first microphone. Two years later, David Edward Huges invented the
        Carbon Microphone which has some variations still used today.In the early 1900's, tube amplifiers were invented which led to the further improvement of the microphone. The microphone was improved upon often in 1920 and in the years after ,
        with innovations such as the ribbon microphone for broadcasting radiostations, the wireless microphone, invented for use on televisions in the late 1950's. In 1983, clip on michrophones were invented which are still used today by a variety
        of people. </a>

          <h3> <a href="https://www.wardbrodt.com/blog/history-of-the-electronic-keyboard-infographic-madison-wisconsin">The first electric keyboard was invented in 1874 by Elisha Grey. It was called the Musical Telegraph. This invention didn't
              catch on for nearly 45 years. The earliest keyboards didn't even use Elisha's technology, but the technology of vacuum tubes. These were called Electric Organs and they didn't have much of a scale due to them needing to be portable.
              Finally, in 1955 the first electrical piano was invented. This was called "The 100" and borrowed many ideas from past keyboards. Years after that, pianos helped contribute to the invention of the modern synthesizer with the invention
              of the Piano Bass by Fender Rhodes.</a> <a href="https://ourpastimes.com/the-history-of-the-electric-keyboard-12310595.html">However, it wasn't until ten years after its initial invention that a piano was added to the Piano Bass. This
              update was made by Bob Moog.Alot of progressive rock songs in the 1970s as well as electronic pop of the 1980's was tied to Moog's invention.<a> </h3>

              set of these were invented by Nathaniel Baldwin in 1910. His idea was dismissed by many,however the US Navy ordered 100 of them.</a><a href="https://coolmaterial.com/roundup/history-of-headphones/"> Years later, in 1937, The DT-48’s
              were the first pair of dynamic headphones became available in stores. These headphones are still widely popular today. In 1958, John Koss created the first pair of stereo headphones. Just a year later, Stax invented the first ever
              electrostatic headphones,leading to Koss also putting out their own pair of electrostatic headphones. Headphones improved greatly with Sony's invention of the walkman in 1979. The walkman required portable headphones so people could
              walk around while listening to music.After this invention, headphones were frequently improved upon with updates such as earbuds that don't mess up the hair of the wearer, noise cancelling headphones, the invention of the ipod by Apple,
              and many other things. </a> </h3>
